Web Sonos Controller version 0.72
=================================

Web Sonos Controller is a very simple controller
for the Sonos (http://www.sonos.com) Music System,
although it might work with any UPnP Music System.

Currently it supports:
* All Control functions: Play, Pause, Next, Previous
* All Volume functions: Mute, Louder, Softer
* Adding/Removing items to the queue
* Creating, Deleting, Using saved Playlists 
* Selecting Radio Station
* Simple plugins

HOW TO USE
==========

* Run sonos.pl from the sonos directory.
* Point your web browser to 
  - "http://localhost:8001/" to select interface and plugins
* Point your RSS reader to 
  - "http://localhost:8001/status.xml" for a simple summary of the zones
* When using the first time, you will have to wait a few minutes for
  an index to be built.  The index is done building when the
  output says it has saved the Music DB
* Click on a Zone
* Click on the other links! :-)

* If you want to try with Konfabulator see the html/iSonosStub.js file for directions

You must have perl installed and all the dependencies listed below.

sonos.pl will create a web server that listens to port 8001,
although that can be changed at the top of sonos.pl.

All the web pages are in the the html directory, and can
be edited freely.  A very simple template system is used
to build everything.


DEPENDENCIES
============
I suggest you using the ActiveState Perl install, see below,
unless you are using Linux.

This program requires at least these other modules and libraries:
Many Linux distributions already come with SOME of them.

UPnP              - Included since patch required. No need to install.
Data::Dumper      perl -MCPAN -e "install Data::Dumper"
SOAP::Lite        perl -MCPAN -e "install SOAP::Lite"
LWP::UserAgent    perl -MCPAN -e "install LWP::UserAgent"
HTTP::Daemon      perl -MCPAN -e "install HTTP::Daemon"
XML::Simple       perl -MCPAN -e "install XML::Simple"
HTML::Template    perl -MCPAN -e "install HTML::Template"

WHY IS UPNP INCLUDED
====================

There are at least 4 changes I had to make to get it to work with the Sonos system,
I'm not sure if this is Sonos or UPnP lib issue.  Since it is included,
there is no need to install it.

SUPPORT
=======

First check for a new version at http://www.purple.org/sonos

Feel free to send mail to sonos@purple.org, and I will try to help out.
If enough people are interested we can move it to SourceForge.

Patches will get a better response then a feature request. :-)

For error reports, please include the output with the -debug option,
so run something like "sonos.pl -debug > output.txt"
